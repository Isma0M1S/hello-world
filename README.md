# hello-world
Hi Humans
This is my First Program on Github, so i'm going to do my best to learn all that i can, and more.
If you want to tell me some tips, i'm going to appreciate.
Also if you have some works of you need a partner in some projects, you can tell me.
I'll try to do the best, and give the work in excellent status.
